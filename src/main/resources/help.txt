This plugin adds a delay functionality to command blocks via the sleep command.

Correct usage is /sleep x y z Time BLOCK BLOCK

Coordinates x y and z can be coordinates or relative coordinates using ` symbol. I tried using ~ but command blocks do not like non vanilla commands using ~
If you want 0 as a reference, use `0 instead of `

Time is in Milliseconds. Example: If you want seconds, multiple by 1000. 5 seconds * 1000 = 5000 MS

The fist block is what you want to set after the time has been reached.

The second block is entirely optional and replaces the first block one game tick afterwards.
I find that useful if you want to set a redstone block to pulse to activate another command block.
