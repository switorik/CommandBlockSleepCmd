This plugin adds a delay functionality to command blocks via the cmdblockdelay command.

Correct usage is /cmdblockdelay x y z time block block time

Coordinates x y and z can be coordinates or relative coordinates using ~ symbol. For a reference of 0, you must use ~0

Time is in server ticks. Example: If you want seconds, multiple by 20. 5 seconds * 20 = 100 Ticks

The fist block is what you want to set after the first time has been reached.

The second block is entirely optional and replaces the first block one game tick afterwards.
The second time is optional if you want to change the amount of time before it changes the second block.
